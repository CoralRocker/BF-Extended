# Brainfuck Extended

## Repository Directory
**[ExamplePrograms/](ExamplePrograms/):** Example programs of Brainfuck-Extended and a how-to file about BF-Extended are in here. <br>
**[src/](src/):** The source code for the BF-Extended interpreters and compiler resides here. It is written in C and works correctly out-of-the-box on all Unix/Linux systems with the standard GNU C library.<br>
**[src/Interpreter/](src/Interpreter/):** The source code for the interpreters is here. Written in C. The makefile included is the preferable way to compile them, but it doesn't really matter.<br>
**[src/Interpreter/Deprecated/](src/Interpreter/Deprecated):** The source code for the deprecated interpreter. If any more become deprecated, they'll be found here. <br>
**[src/Compiler/](src/Compiler/):** The source code for the compiler is here. Written in and compiles to C. There is a makefile in here which compiles BFE programs for you. <br>
**[src/Debugger/](src/Debugger/):** The python source code for the debugging engine (WIP) lies here. Not very exciting, just a slower version of the C interpreter right now. <br>
