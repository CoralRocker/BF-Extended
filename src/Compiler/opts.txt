---All Optimizations are added cumulatively; e.g. 3rd opt contains 2 & 1, but not 4---

NoOpt = no meaningful optimizations in place
OptSum = addition and subtraction operations concatenated to be a small as possible
OptSpace = meaningless whitespace removed from program (anything either inbetween @s, 's, "s)
OptZero = [-] operations are shortened to *ptr = 0
OptShift = Concatenate shifting operations into one.
OptCopy = Concatenate copy operations down to one move operation
