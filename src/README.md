## Directory Listing
**[Interpreter/](Interpreter/):** The source code for the interpreters is here. Written in C. The makefile included is the preferable way to compile them, but it doesn't really matter.<br>
**[Interpreter/Deprecated/](Interpreter/Deprecated):** The source code for the deprecated interpreter. If any more become deprecated, they'll be found here. <br>
**[Compiler/](Compiler/):** The source code for the compiler will be here. The compiler isn't yet written though. Sorry.<br>
